        is the birthplace of the very beloved Lord Krishna. Located in the state
        of Uttar Pradesh, Mathura and Vrindavan are often considered twin cities

        with temples from various ages and attracts a horde of pilgrims from all
        over the world. One side of Mathura is stretched across the Yamuna
        River, lined with 25 ghats, which are best visited during dawn when you
        can witness locals and tourists taking a holy dip, and at dawn (just
        after the sunset) when hundreds of diyas are floated during the daily
        aarti. Mathura is flooded with tourists and pilgrims during the two main
        festivals - Janmashtami (Lord Krishna's birthday) in August/September,
        and Holi in February/March. Shri Krishna Janmabhumi is the most famous
        tourist attraction in Mathura, as this place is believed to the be the

        born is now on display for tourists to see. Mathura has many temples,
        both big and small, dotting the entire city, with many of these temples
        being dedicated to Lord Krishna. The two most important temples in town

        located on the bank of Gomti River. It is the largest city in U.P. with
        an area of 3244 sq km. The city also serves as the administrative
        headquarters of Lucknow District and Division. It is believed that the
        city derives its name from Lakshman (locally told as Lakhan) younger
        brother of Lord Rama. Since 1351 AD Lucknow and the Awadh region were
        jointly ruled by the Delhi Sultanate. After that at the end of 16th
        century it was gone under the Mughal rulers. Usually, this province was
        ruled by Nawabs who were appointed by Mughals. There after Lucknow was
        captured by East India Company during colonial rule (British Raj).
        Finally, after the independence of India, Lucknow became the capital
        city of Uttar Pradesh. Now, the city is counted as one of the fastest
        growing semi-metropolitan cities in India.

        Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated
        in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is
        a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river.

        5.Vrindavan - uttar pradesh One of the oldest cities on the banks of
        Yamuna, Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places
        of pilgrimage for the devotees of Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna
        had spent his childhood in Vrindavan. The name of the city has been
        derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and van (meaning grove) which
        perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since
        Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people
        come here to abandon their worldly life. The city of Vrindavan hosts
        hundreds of Lord Krishna and Radha temples scattered throughout, the
        most famous ones being Banke Bihari temple and the world-famous ISKCON
        temple. The vibrant surroundings perfectly depict the playful and
        benevolent nature of Lord Krishna. Located along the waters of River
        Yamuna, the numerous temples set amidst the thick woods and lush
        greenery of Vrindavan are the major attractions here.
