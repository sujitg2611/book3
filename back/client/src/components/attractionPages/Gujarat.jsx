        The Gir Forests- the largest compact tract of dry deciduous forests in
        the semi-arid western part of India is the last abode of the big and
        regal predator, Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), an endangered
        animal species. The sanctuary is internationally acclaimed for
        successfully saving this precious species from the brink of extinction.
        It was declared as a sanctuary in 1965. Subsequently out of the 1153.42
        sq. km area of the sanctuary, an area of 258.71 sq. km. was declared a
        National Park. Gir Forests has a topography made up of successive rugged
        ridges, isolated hills, plateaus and valleys. Besides, being the last
        abode of Asiatic lions, Gir Forests forms a unique habitat for many
        mammals, reptiles, birds and insect species along with a rich variety of
        flora.

      <h1>3.Jhulta minar - gujarat</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Also known as the Shaking Minarets, they are playful but with a whir of
        quivering mystery. They have left the best of architects and pioneering
        design engineers intrigued and in unresolvable wonder. What they cannot
        unravel is when one minaret is shaken the other begins to vibrate,
        though the connecting passage between the two remains vibration-free;
        what causes this vibration is unknown. There are two well-known pairs of
        Shaking Minarets in Ahmedabad, one located opposite the Sarangpur
        Darwaja and the other near the Kalupur Railway Station Area. The one
        near Sarangpur Darwaja is within the vicinity of the Sidi Bashir Mosque
        built in 1452 AD by Sidi Bashir, a slave of Sultan Ahmed Shah. They are
        three storeys tall with carved balconies where visitors were once
        allowed to climb all the way up. The other set of minarets near the
        Railway Station is taller in height. However, these are not in a very
        good condition as it is believed that the British had dismantled them to
        understand the cause of vibrations. They could not resolve the
        engineering and it was not possible to put them back in their original
        condition. Demonstrations of the minarets shaking or vibrating are not
        carried out anymore.

      <h1>4.Kankaria lake - gujarat</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cuddled in the Southern area of Ahmedabad, Kankaria Lake is the biggest
        lake in Ahmedabad. Kankaria Lake is a 550 years old artificial lake,
        built by Sultan Qutbuddin in the 15th century. Once upon a time, the
        lake was used by the king for bathing. Currently, the lakeside of
        Kankaria is a major entertainment hub of Ahmedabad. Whether its thrill
        or adventure, whatever the tourist seeks they will find it here. The
        lakefront is developed by the Ahmedabad city governments and offers some
        of the best urban facilities like tethered balloon safari, train ride,
        ultra-modern high-speed rides and kid's specific activities. Every year
        in the month of December, Kankaria Carnival kicks off celebrating the
        cultural and historical heritage of Ahmedabad.

      <h1>5.Somnath - gujarat</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The intricately carved honey-coloured Somnath temple on the western edge
        of the state is believed to be the place where the first of the twelve
        holy jyotirlingas emerged in India – a spot where Shiva appeared as a
        fiery column of light. The temples lies at the meeting of Kapila, Hiran
        and Sarasvati rivers and the waves of the Arabian Sea ebb and flow
        touching the shore on which it is constructed. The ancient temple’s
        timeline can be traced from 649 BC but is believed to be older than
        that. The present form was reconstructed in 1951. Colourful dioramas of
        the Shiva story line the north side of the temple garden, though it’s
        hard to see them through the hazy glass. A one-hour sound-and-light show
        in Amitabh Bachchan’s baritone highlights the temple nightly at 7.45pm.
