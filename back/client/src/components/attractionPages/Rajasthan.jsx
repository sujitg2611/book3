        1.Bhilwara - rajasthan Famous as the ‘city of textiles and looms’,
        Bhilwara is home to the world renowned Ramdwara of Ramsnehi Sampraday.
        The founder Guru of the Sampraday, Swami Ramcharanji Maharaj, preached
        to his followers here and later decided to move to Shahpura. The present
        day headquarters of the Ram Snehi Sampraday, known as Ram Niwas Dham are
        located in Shahpura. Some people say that Bhilwara got its name from the
        Bhils (tribal people) who lived there during the days of yore. As per a
        story, the city of Bhilwara had a mint that minted coins known as
        ‘bhiladi’. This is supposedly the origin of the district’s name.
        Bhilwara's cultural history can also be traced back to the Nagar
        Brahmins mentioned in the Skanda Purana.

        Mountain forms a natural border between Ajmer and Pushkar. Known as ‘the
        rose garden of Rajasthan’, the essence of the famous Pushkar rose is
        exported all over the world. Along with an interesting mythological
        history, a legacy of timeless architectural heritage makes Pushkar a
        fascinating city. According to legends, Lord Brahma, believed to be the
        creator of the Universe dropped a lotus to the ground leading to the
        immediate creation of a lake. He then decided to name the place after
        the flower, and thus the name, Pushkar. The city of Pushkar is home to
        the only temple dedicated to Lord Brahma in the whole world. Hindus
        consider a journey to Pushkar to be the ultimate pilgrimage that must be
        undertaken to attain salvation.
