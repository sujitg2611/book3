        Bangalore also refers to as Garden City of India due to its wide range
        of gardens and parks throughout the city. Today, Bangalore is a home of
        many well-recognized colleges and research centres, private industries,
        software companies, telecommunications, defence organizations,
        aerospace, etc. Bangalore is also called as the Silicon Valley of India
        due to its nation leading position in IT Market. Bangalore is India’s
        second fastest growing cosmopolitan city with the rapid growth of
        numerous industries (speciously IT Industries). As a result of vastly
        industrialization for last few years, population rate also increased
        rapidly. According the census report 2011 India, approximately 8,443,675
        people reside in Bangalore Metro city which makes it the third most
        populated metro city in India. Rapid population growth and faster
        growing industrialization does not succeed to make the city polluted
        like other metropolises of India, because, Bangalore is greener than
        other cities of India and the authority body of Bangalore determined to
        keep the city pollution free.

      <h1>2.Coorg - karnataka</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Coorg or Kodagu as it is officially known now, is an astonishing land in
        the heart of the southern Indian peninsula. This unspoilt “country of
        million hills”, situated on the slopes of the Western Ghats, is India’s
        coffee bowl. The tiny district in the state of Karnataka is the biggest
        producer of coffee. The only way to reach this nature’ s guarded resort
        is to motor down from Mysore, Mangalore or Hassan towns, all in the
        state of Karnataka or from Kannur or Tellicherry in Kerala state.
        Madikeri is 120 km from Mysore and 260 km from Bangalore. Coorg,
        sandwiched between Karnataka and Kerala States, is well-connected by bus
        service and is two hours drive from Mysore. The drive is worth it as one
        could enjoy miles of greenery, thick forests, acres and acres of coffee
        estates and shimmering streams.

      <h1>3.Hampi - karnataka</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hampi is one of finest historical sites of ancient age in the world. It
        was the initial capital city of famous historical Vijayanagara Empire
        located on the bank of Tungabhadra River about 11 km away from Hospet
        City. Hampi is a small location covered an area of 25 sq. km. and it is
        totally bounded by mountains (Anjaneya, Malyavanta and Matanga Hills) by
        the three sites and rest one site is bordered by Tungabhadra River. It
        is believed by Hindus that Hampi was a kingdom of Monkeys (according to
        the Ramayana) before Vijayanagara Empire in pre-ancient age (around 1
        CE) when the city was known as Kishkindha. The traditional culture of
        Hampi will drag your mind to be a witness of this culture and
        architecture. Hampi was served as capital city of Vijayanagara Empire
        more over 200 years (around 1336 AD to 1565 AD). Vijayanagara Rulers
        decorated and designed this city with lots of lovely temples, palaces,
        market streets and monuments which made this location one of the famous
        ancient metropolises in India.

      <h1>5.Bandipur national park - karnataka</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Bandipur National Park is regarded as one of the most beautiful and
        better-managed national parks of India. Located amidst the picturesque
        surroundings of the towering Western Ghats on the Mysore-Ooty highway in
        Karnataka, it is an important part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve that
        constitutes Karnataka’s Rajiv Gandhi National Park (Nagarahole) to its
        Northwest, Tamil Nadu’s Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary to its South, and
        Kerala’s Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary to its Southwest. The total extent
        of Bandipur National Park is 872.24 sq km. It is located partly in
        Gundlupet taluk of Chamarajanagar District and partly in H.D.Kote and
        Nanjangud taluks of Mysuru District. Once the private hunting grounds of
        the erstwhile Maharajas, and nestled at the foothills of the Nilgiris,
        Bandipur has had a long tryst with tigers. One of the thirty reserves
        identified across the country to save the tiger and its habitat, it’s
        also one of the last refuges of the endangered Asiatic wild elephant.
        Apart from the two famed residents, a number of other endangered species
        such as sloth bears, gaurs, Indian rock pythons, jackals, muggers, and
        four-horned antelopes can be spotted in this national park. Bandipur
        also shelters sambar, mouse deer, chital, sloth bear, and the rare
        flying lizard. Over 200 species of birds and a diversity of flora add to
        its attraction. Bandipur also supports a wide range of timber trees
        including teak, rosewood, sandalwood, Indian-laurel, Indian Kino tree,
        giant clumping bamboo, etc.
