        The Rohtang pass at 13,050 feet ( 4,350 metres ), 51 km. North of Manali
        gateway to the valleys of Lahaul and Spiti lies on the main Manali-Leh
        highway. It has remained the main attraction for all tourists visiting
        this picturesque hill resort. During the season from early June to
        mid-October, thousands of tourists visit the pass eavery day. Besides
        affording a magnificent view of the snow-clad mountains of Lahaul, this
        pass is also the source of the river Beas. This river while fulfilling
        the thirst of many local travellers, also quenches the thirst of the
        fields of Punjab and Pakistan before flowing into the Arabian Sea. Thr
        river emerges from a cavern at the Rohtang pass and assume different
        identities as the seasons go by.

      <h1>2.Dharamshala - himachal pradesh</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dharamsala is located in the district of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh.
        What many people don’t know is that there are two parts of the city. One
        is known as Lower Dharamshala, which is its commercial center and dotted
        with markets, courts and the famous Kotwali Bazaar, where you come
        across items of everyday use. Upper Dharamshala is home to Mcleodganj as
        well as other structures which remind you of its colonial past. The two
        different parts of the city have something different to offer. As a
        tourist, it offers you the opportunity to unwind and take in the beauty
        of the surroundings.

      <h1>3.Dalhousie - himachal pradesh</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dalhousie is one of the most famous hill stations of Himachal Pradesh.
        It stretches itself leisurely through the five mountains, Kathlog,
        Potreyn, Terah, Bakrota and Bhangora. It was established by Lord
        Dalhousie in 1850, and there are many things that remind you of its
        colonial past. Sightseeing though, is one of the many ways of keeping
        yourself busy here. Those visiting Dalhousie do so to be in the company
        of nature, and it keeps them company always. It doesn’t matter which
        part of the town you may be in, the sight of snowcapped peaks of
        Dhauladhar Range greet you constantly. The clouds embrace the mountains
        in the distance, while the greenery of the landscape is brought out by
        the sun’s rays in another. This contrast lightens the mood and cheers
        you up. A trip to Dalhousie is largely about sightseeing, because the
        landscape lends itself perfectly to this activity.
