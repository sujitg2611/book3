      <h1>5.Leepakshi temple - andhra pradesh</h1>
      <p>
        The Lepakshi temple, also known as Veerbhadra temple is located in the
        tiny hamlet of Anantapur District of Andhra Pradesh. It is a paragon of
        excellent architecture and art. It is famous for its architecture
        characterised by hanging pillars and cave chambers that can astound you!
        Once the essence of Vijayanagara Empire, Lepakshi is culturally and
        archaeologically significant as it acts as the prime location of the
        shrine dedicated to Veerabhadra. The Lepakshi Temple is an exhibition of
        timeless art, with famous frescoes and murals. Another thing that makes
        the temple unique and a place to must visit is a footprint that is
        believed to be of Maa Sita. As soon as you step inside the temple, you
        get the glimpses of the history of Vijayanagara kingdom by way of
        pictorial representations. From the figures of musicians and saints to
        that of Parvati and Lord Shiva, the Lepakshi Temple has everything which
        makes it an attraction of archaeological and artistic splendour. Apart
        from the architectural importance, the temple according to Skanda Purana
        is a divyakshetra, in other words, an important pilgrimage destination
        of Lord Shiva.
