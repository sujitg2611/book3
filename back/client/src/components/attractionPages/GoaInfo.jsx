        and handicrafts, European snacks, cassettes of a noisy brand of music
        called 'Goa Trance', artificial ornaments carvings and T-shirts. An

        ancient Hindu temple dedicated to the powerful deity Ravalnath,
        incarnation of Lord Shiva. This Church was constructed in 1597 with
        financial help from the Communidade of Curtorim. The Church was rebuilt
        in 1647 and today is a magnificent structure standing majestically by
        the side of Angoddi Tollem one of the five big lakes in Curtorim. The

        Church has more of a contemporary 18th century styled design with lively
        decorations similar to the Mangueshi temple at Priol. The Alex Church

        some part of the walls having red laterite while the other part painted
        with white only the façade and the porch plastered.
