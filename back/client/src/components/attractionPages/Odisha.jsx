        dynasty was, on the ravages of a temple which used to exist there. Apart
        from that, what pulls pilgrims to this place of worship even more is the
        annual Ratha Yatra (Chariot festival). One major ceremony followed in
        the festival is the public procession of the three principal deities of
        the temple present on embellished temple cars. Another interesting fact
        about this temple is that usually the idols are sculpted out of metal
        and stone but at Jagannath Temple, the idols are carved out of wood
        which are restored every twelve or nineteen years.
